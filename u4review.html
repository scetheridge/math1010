    <li>Write a linear equation for the cost of leasing a car with a $1000 down payment and a $360 per month charge.</li>
    <p class="solution">y = 360x + 1000</p>
    <li>State and interpret the rate of change shown in the graph:</li>
<img src="images/u4reviewp2.png" alt="A linear graph that is decreasing from left to right. The x-axis represents the hours and goes from 0 to 8 counting by 1. The y-axis represents the money in the wallet and goes from 0 to 50 counting by 10. Two points on the graph are (0,50) and (8,0). ">
<p class="solution">The money in the wallet decreases by $6.25 per hour spent at the casino</p>

<li>Write the equation of the line shown in the graph:</li>

    <li>Joseph spent his vacation time in Kalamazoo, Michigan, a distance of 552 miles from his home. He drives home at an average speed of 55 mph.
        <ol>
            <li>What is the independent variable and the dependent variable in this scenario.</li>
            <p class="solution">Independent variable - time in hours</p>
            <p class="solution">Dependent variable - distance from home in hours</p>
            <li>Write an equation that models the distance Joseph is from home relative to the amount of time he has been driving.</li>
            <p class="solution">y = 552 - 55x</p>
            <li>How far from home is Joseph if he has been driving for 7 hours?</li>
            <p class="solution">167 miles</p>
            <li>How long will it take Joseph to get home?</li>
            <p class="solution">approximately 10 hours</p>

<li>	A 3-month-old Australian Shepherd female puppy weighed 12 pounds. When she was 3 years old, she weighed 44 pounds. Find the average rate of change and explain its meaning within the context of this scenario.</li>
<p class="solution">The rate of change is equal to 1. The puppy was gaining approximately one pound per month.</p>

<li>How many male doctors work at the hospital?</li>
<p class="solution">150</p>

<img src="images/u4reviewp7.png" alt="A Venn Diagram titled with two intersecting circles. One circle represents the number of doctors and the other circle represents the number of women. The number 20 is in the intersection of the circles. The number 150 is in the doctors circle and the number 275 is in the women circle. The number 162 is outside both circles."> 

<li>Draw a Venn diagram to represent the following information: At a high school 70 students are involved in cross country or swimming. Fifty students run cross country and 40 students are on the swim team. How many students both run cross country and belong to the swim team?</li>
<p class="solution"><img src="images/u4reviewp8k.png" alt="A Venn Diagram with two intersecting circles.
