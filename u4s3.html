      <h2>Linear Modeling and Logic Unit </h2>
  
<h4>4.3 Writing Equations of Lines</h4>
<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>On August 5, 2010, a gold-and-copper mine collapsed in Chile, trapping 33 miners underground.  Rescuers used a drilling rig to reach the miners under the earth’s surface.  An escape capsule carried each miner up the shaft at a constant rate as shown in the graph.</p>

<p><img src="images/u4s3intro.png" alt="The Miner Rescue graph is a linear graph that is increasing from left to right. The x-axis represents the time in seconds and goes from 0 to 800 counting by 100. The y-axis represents the depth in feet and goeas from -2500 to 500. Two points on the graph are (0,-2050) and (680,0). "></p>

<ol>
    <li>At what underground depth were the miners trapped?</li>
    <p class="solution">2040 feet underground</p>
    <li>How long has a miner been ascending in the escape capsule when he reaches a depth of 300 feet?</li>
    <p class="solution">580 seconds</p>
    <li>How long did it take to bring each miner to the surface?</li>
    <p class="solution">680 seconds</p>
    <li>At what average rate did the escape capsule carry each miner up the shaft?</li>
    <p class="solution">\( \begin{equation} \frac{-300-0}{580-680}=\frac{-300}{-100}= \text{ 3 feet per second} \end{equation} \) </p>
    <li>Write an expression for the depth of the miner during his rescue with respect to time ascending.</li>
    <p class="solution">y = 3x - 2040</p>

</ol>
<h4>Group Assignment</h4>
<ol>
<li>Use the graph “People With Health Insurance,” which estimates the U.S. population with health insurance in the given years, to answer the following questions.   
  <br>
  <br>
<img src="images/u4s3p1.png" alt="The graph is linear and increases from left to right. The x-axis represents the number of years since 1989 and goes from 0 to 6 counting by 1. The y-axis represents the number of poeple in millions and goes from 0 to 250. The points plotted on the graph are (0,212), (1,214), (2,216), (3,218), (4,220), and (5,222). ">
<ol>
    <li>How many people had health insurance in 1990?</li>
    <p class="solution">214 million</p>
    <li>How many people had health insurance in 1991?</li>
    <p class="solution">216 million</p>
    <li>At what rate is the number of people with health insurance increasing each year?</li>
    <p class="solution">2 million per year</p>
    <li>According to the graph, how many people would you expect to have had health insurance in 1988?</li>
    <p class="solution">210 million</p>
    <li>According to the graph, how many people would you expect to have had health insurance in 2014?</li>
    <p class="solution">262 million</p>
    <li>The actual number of people in the U.S. with health insurance in 2014 was about 276 million.  Why do you think this differs from your estimate in question (e)?</li>
    <p class="solution">The function is probably not a linear relationship or the actual number could reflect that the Affordable Care Act was enacted in 2013.</p>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Use the graph “Josh’s Car Trip” to answer the following questions.
  <br>
<img src="images/u4s3p2.png" alt="The graph is linear and decreases from left to right. The x-axis represents the time in hours and goeas from 0 to 4 counting by 1.

<ol>
  <li>Is Josh traveling away from home or towards his home during his trip?</li>
  <p class="solution">toward home</p>
  <li>How many miles long is Josh’s trip?</li>
  <p class="solution">160 miles</p>
  <li>How long does Josh’s trip take?</li>
  <p class="solution">4 hours</p>
  <li>What is Josh’s speed during his trip?</li>
  <p class="solution">40 mph</p>
  <li>At this rate, how long would it take Josh to complete a 3300 miles trek across the United States?  If he could only drive 8 hours a day, how many days would it take him?</li>
  <p class="solution">82.5 hours which is 10.3 days when he is driving 8 hours per day.</p>
</ol>
<li>Use the graph “Demand Curve” to answer the following questions.

The y-axis represents the units sold and goes from 0 to 80,000 counting by 20,000. Two points on the graph are (0,70000) and (350,0) ">
<ol>
  <li>When the cost of the product is $100, how many units are sold?</li>
  <p class="solution">50,000 units</p>
  <li>When the cost of the product is $200, how many units are sold?</li>
  <p class="solution">30,000 units</p>
  <li>When the cost of the product is $300, how many units are sold?</li>
  <p class="solution">10,000 units</p>
  <li>Is demand increasing or decreasing with respect to cost?</li>
  <p class="solution">decreasing</p>
<li>What is the rate of change for units sold for every dollar increase?</li>
<p class="solution">-200 units per dollar</p>
<li>Which brings in the most money:  selling the product for $100, $200, or $300?  (Take into account how many units are sold at each price)</li>
<p class="solution">Selling the product for $200 brings in the most money.</p>
<li>At what cost does the demand hit zero?</li>
<p class="solution">$350</p>

</ol>

</li>

      <li>What is the initial cost of the cell phone (at month zero)?  What might this amount represent?</li>
      <p class="solution">$60</p>
      <p class="solution">This cost may represent taxes or a down payment for the cell phone.</p>
      <li>What is the cost of the cell phone at 12 months?</li>
      <p class="solution">$540</p>
      <li>What is the cost of the cell phone at 6 months?</li>
