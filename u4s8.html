      <h3>4.8 Venn Diagrams</h3>
<br>
      <h4>Government: Who Takes Care of What?</h4>
      <br>
      <ol>
      <li><strong>Federal, State, and Local governments each have responsibilities for services to citizens. Sometimes these responsibilities overlap.</strong>
        <br>
          <p>Use a Venn Diagram to illustrate which government(s) is responsible for each of the following.</p>
          <ol>
              <li>Safe Travels: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ensures that flying is safe.</li>
              <li>How Green it is! National and state governments create and maintain about 300 million acres of parks and forests.</li>
              <li>Road Trip! About 4 million miles of roads criss-cross the country.</li>
              <li>Behind the Wheel: Every state has a Department of Motor Vehicles.</li>
              <li>Quick, call 9-1-1: Your communities first responders-firefighters, police, and EMTs-are there in minutes.</li>
              <li>Vote! The Constitution establishes how national elections are held.  Local governments, with State oversite, arrange for polling places where people cast their votes.</li>
              <li>How Much? The U.S. mint manufactures and distributes the coins we use.  The Bureau of Engraving and Printing prints our paper money.</li>
              <li>P-U! That’s what you might say without garbage collection provided by your community’s sanitation department.</li>
              <li>Electing our President: Every state chooses electors for the Electoral College.  Electors cast votes for whichever candidate gets the majority of votes in the state.</li>
              <li>Ensuring National Security: The Department of Defense provides the military forces needed to prevent war and keep our country safe.</li>
              <li>Correctional Facilities: Prisons—house people who have been convicted of a crime.</li>
              <li>Getting Well: A state controls all the hospitals within its borders and exerts direct control over specific facilities.</li>
              <li>Read, Play, Enjoy: If you like libraries, sports fields, parks, and other recreation facilities in your community, say thank-you to your local government.</li>
              <li>Go fish! But first you will need a state-issued license. The same goes for hunting.</li>
              <li>Protecting Plants and Animals: U.S. Fish and Wildlife focuses on protecting endangered species.</li>
              <li>Your teachers, your schools: Local communities hire teachers, build schools, and provide transportation to and from school. What gets taught is the state’s responsibility.</li>
              <li>To Your Health! The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves all medicine and sets food safety standards.</li>
              <li>Ratify! Any amendment to our Constitution must be approved, or ratified, by 38 states.</li>
              <li>Electricity, natural gas, and water are necessities to be managed and distributed.  Local communities are in charge.</li>
              <li>Bumpety-bump! Without your local government to repair the roads and fix potholes, you may end up with a rough ride.</li>
              <li>Tests to Pass! Lawyers and other professionals must pass a state licensing exam in the state where they plan to work.</li>
              <li>Learning more on your behalf: The National Institute of Health (NIH) supports research into the causes and cures of diseases.</li>
              <li>Safe and Sound. Community police, state troopers, the National Guard, and the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) work to fight crime</li>
          </ol>
      </li>
     
    <br>
    <br>

  <p class="solution"> 4</p>
      </li>
<li>How many responsibilities do local governments have?
  <p class="solution"> 9</p>
          </li>
<li>How many responsibilities are shared by federal and local governments?
  <p class="solution"> 3</p>
              </li>
<li>How many responsibilities are only fulfilled by one level of government?
  <p class="solution"> 17</p>

      <img src="images/u4s8p1.png" alt="A Venn diagram of Mrs. Mac's kindergarten class. There are three intersectings circles in the diagram.  The circle on the top left is labeled can read.  The circle on the top right is labeled left-handed.  The circle on the bottom is labeled can count to 100.  The intersection of all three circles has a 1 in it.  The intersection of the can count to 100 and left-handed is empty.  The intersection of can count to 100 and can read is 4, and the intersection of can read and left-handed is 2.  The can read area with no intersection with the other circles is 6, left-handed 5, and can count to 100 3.  There are 4 students outside all the circles.">
