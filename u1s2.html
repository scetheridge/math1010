        <li>Probability is the long-term chance that a certain outcome will occur from some random process.  What is the probability of a fair coin landing heads up when flipped?  What is the probability that a person rolls a 3 when rolling a fair die?  Write these probabilities as decimals and percentages.
          <p>\(Probability\;of\;event\;A\;=\frac{number\;of\;outcomes\;in\;event\;A}{total\;number\;of\;outcomes}\)</p>
          <p class="solution"> \( P(heads)= \frac{1}{2}=0.5=50\%\)</p>
          <p class="solution"> \( P(3)= \frac{1}{6}=0.1667=16.67\%\)</p>
          </li>

        <li>Suppose you flip a fair coin three times in a row.  What is the probability that it lands on heads every time?  Make a tree diagram to show the possible outcomes when flipping a coin three times in a row.
            <p class="solution">  <img src="images/u1s2p8.png" alt="tree diagram for tossing a coin 3 times. For the first toss, the possible outcomes are heads (H) or tails (T) for a total of 2 branches.  For the second toss, the tree branches from the first H or T.  There are two branches off the H, one an H and the other a T.  There are also two branches off the T, one an H and the other a T.  After the 2nd toss there are four branches.   For the third toss, each of the 4 branches from the 2nd toss are branched with an H and a T, for a total of 8 branches.  The sample space outcomes are listed: HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT  "></p>
            <p class="solution"> \( P(3H)= \frac12\cdot\frac12\cdot\frac12=\frac18=0.125=12.5\%\)</p>
        </li>

        <li>How many times would you expect a fair coin to land heads up if you flip the coin ten times in a row? Flip an actual coin ten times in a row and record the outcomes.  Compare with your prediction.  Why might they not be the same?
            <p class="solution"> 5 times</p>
            <p class="solution">Theoretical probability is what we expect to happen, where experimental probability is what actually happens when we try it out.</p>
        </li>

        <li>In the 2018-2019 regular season, NBA basketball player Steph Curry attempted 287 free throws and made 263 of them.  What is the probability that Steph Curry will make a free throw?  Write this probability as a fraction, as a decimal, and as a percentage.
            <p class="solution"> \( P(Make)= \frac{263}{287}=0.9164=91.64\%\)</p>
         
        </li>

        <li>Kingsport, TN has a population of 53,091 and had 2954 instances of violent and property crime in 2014.  Knoxville, TN has a population of 185,638 and had 12,863 instances of violent and property crime in 2014.  Which is the safer city?  How many crimes occurred per 100 people in each city?
            <p class="solution"> Kingsport: \(\frac{2954}{53,091}=0.0556=5.56\%=\frac{5.56}{100}\)</p>
            <p class="solution"> Knoxville: \(\frac{12,863}{185,638}=0.0693=6.93\%=\frac{6.93}{100}\)</p>
            <p class="solution"> Kingsport is the safer city.</p>
        </li>
      
        <li>There are 400 boys and 420 girls in a school. If 18% of the boys are left-handed and 10% of the girls are left-handed, what percentage of students in the school are left-handed?
                <p class="solution">18% of 400 boys = 0.18 * 400 = 72 left-handed boys</p>
                <p class="solution"> 10% of 420 girls = 0.10 * 420 = 42 left-handed girls</p>
                <p class="solution"> \(72 + 42 = 114\) left-handed students</p>
                <p class="solution"> \(\frac{114\;\text{ left-handed}}{820\;\text{total students}}\)  = 0.14 </p>
                <p class="solution"> 14% of the students are left-handed.</p>
        </li>

      
        <li>Is a discount of 30% off the original price, followed by a discount of 50% off the sale price, the same as a discount of 80% off the original price?  (Hint: What would a $100 item cost after these discounts?)
            <p class="solution"> \(100\cdot0.30=30\)</p>
            <p class="solution"> \(100-30=70\)</p>
            <p class="solution"> \(70\cdot0.50=35\)</p>
            <p class="solution"> \(70-35=35\)</p>
            <p class="solution"> You will pay $35 for the item marked 30% off and then 50% off.</p>
            <p class="solution"> \(100\cdot0.80=80\)</p>
              <p class="solution"> \(100-80=20\)</p>
              <p class="solution"> You will pay $20 for the item marked 80% off.</p>
              <p class="solution"> They are not the same.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Jacob has a part time job at Food City. He started out earning $7.50 an hour, but recently got a raise to $8.00 an hour. His mother, Amy, teaches full time at Pellissippi State. Her salary last year was $50,500. This year she got a raise and her current salary is $53,000. Who got the better raise?
                <p class="solution"> Jacob: \( \frac{8.00-7.50}{7.50}=\frac{0.50}{7.50}\approx0.067\approx6.7\%\)</p>
                <p class="solution"> Amy: \( \frac{53,000-50,500}{50,500}=\frac{2500}{50,500}=0.05=5\%\)</p>
                <p class="solution"> Jacob got the better raise.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Last year a company made a net profit of $20,000 on sales of $1,000,000. This year they made a net profit of $40,000 on sales of $1,000,000. When talking to the shareholders, the company executives claimed that their profit increased by 100%, and asked for a bonus for doing so well. When talking to the union about a possible wage raise, the company executives claimed that their profit only increased by 2%, which hasn't even kept up with inflation. How did they determine these figures? Which one do you think is correct??
            <p class="solution"> The absolute change in profit is from $20,000 to $40,000 so it doubles.</p>
            <p class="solution"> The profit percentage is 2% last year and 4% this year so the percentage also doubles.</p>
