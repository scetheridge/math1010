<li>Use the bar graphs to answer the questions.
    <p><img src="images/u2reviewp9.png" alt="The first bar graph represents the Total CO2 emissions by country. The emissions are recorded in millions of metric tons. China's bar is at 6500. the U.S. is at 5900, Russia is at 1800, Japan is at 1600, India is at 1400, Germany is at 1000, Canada is at 500 and the United Kingdom is at 500. The second bar graph represents the per person CP2 emisions and is measured in metric tons. The U.S. is at 19, Canada is at 17, Russia is at 12, Germany is at 10, Japan is at 9, the United Kingdom is at 9, China is at 5 and India is at 1. "></p>
    <ol>
        <li>What is the total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for Canada?  </li>
        <p class="solution">About 500 million metric tons</p>
        <li>What is the per-person CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for Germany?  </li>
        <p class="solution">about 10 metric tons</p>
        <li>Would you say China has a worse problem with CO<sub>2</sub> emissions than the United States?</li>
        <p class="solution">China has greater total CO<sub>2</sub>emissions even though they have less per person emissions due to the larger population. The area of China and the U.S. are similar (China is slightly larger), so you might conclude that China does have a worse problem.</p>

        <li>Why might the homicide rates have decreased since 1995?</li>
        <p class="solution">The decrease in homicides rates could possibly be due to the increase in law enforcement agencies or possibly stricter laws and greater penalties.</p>

<li>98.9% of the households in Connecticut have telephones (landline or cell).  94.6% of the Arkansas households have telephones.  Choose one of the following charts to represent the numbers.  Defend your choice with reasons.</li>

<p class="solution">The second graph is the better graph because it correctly represents the data. In the first graph, it appears that Connecticutt has far more households with phones than Arkansas.</p>

<li>Apple Computer introduced the iMac computer in August 1998. The initial demand for the iMac was very high and Apple sold as many iMacs as they could make. One issue of great concern to Apple was whether the iMac was attracting new customers and therefore expanding the base of Macintosh users or were they only being bought by old customers who already owned a Macintosh.


    <p>To investigate, ComputerWare asked 500 of its iMac purchasers what computer they owned or had owned.  Of the 500 purchasers, 83 were new computer owners who had never owned a computer before, 60 had previously owned a Windows-based computer, and 357 had owned a Macintosh.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Calculate the percentage of iMac purchasers who were new computer owners.</li>
    <p class="solution">16.6%</p>
    <li>What is the population of the study?</li>
    <p class="solution">iMac users</p>
    <li>What is the sample population?</li>
    <p class="solution">500 iMac purchasers in 1998</p>
    <li>What are the sample statistics in the study?</li>
    <p class="solution">Out of 500, 83 were new computer owners (16.6%), 60 were previous Windows computer owners (12%), and 357 were previous Mac computer owners (71.4%).</p>
    <li>What type of study was this?</li>
    <p class="solution">observational</p>
    <li>If the margin of error was 3.5%, what is the confidence interval for the percentage of iMac purchasers who were new computer owners?</li>
    <p class="solution">13.1% - 20.1%</p>
    <li>After one year and the sale of 2,000,000 iMacs, Apple reported that one third of the new buyers of iMacs are first-time computer buyers.  Is this within the confidence interval?</li>
    <p class="solution">No</p>
    <li>Is this sampling error or might there be other factors at work here?</li>
    <p class="solution">other factors such as rise of personal computer ownership</p>

<li>A statistical study of the life of a certain tire produced a normal distribution.  The mean life of the tire is 30,000 km. The standard deviation is 2000 km.

     <li>What percent of the tires will have a life that exceeds 26,000 km?</li>   
     <p class="solution">97.5%</p>   
     <li>If a company purchased 2000 of these tires, how many tires would you expect to last more than 28,000 km?</li>
