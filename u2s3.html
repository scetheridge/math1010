      <h3>2.3 Interpreting Graphs</h3>
 
<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>In mathematics classes, you will learn how to draw many different types of graphs, from linear and quadratic graphs to graphs of trigonometric functions if you take Precalculus. When drawing these graphs, it is sometimes fairly easy to get the points plotted and connect them appropriately, but it is more difficult to explain what the points and other parts of the graph mean. Graphs are not just a bunch of random points placed on a grid to form a line or curve. Each point on the graph has a specific meaning in context of the stated problem. In this lesson, you will gain a firmer understanding of how to look at parts of a graph and give a clear interpretation of what each part means within the context of the problem.</p>

<p>The graph below is called a scatter plot of points. A scatter plot is a collection of points showing the relationship between two variables. Sometimes, a trend may be recognized by these points, but at other times, there may be no trend as in the example below.</p>

<img src="images/u2s3intro1.png" alt="The graph is a scatter plot of points. The x-axis represents the age of each person in years and the y-axis represents the height of each person in inches. the points that are plotted on the graph are (10,60), (15,62), (15,66), (20,60), (20,76), (30,72), (35,62), (35,68), (40,66), (50,64), (55,72), (60,62), (65,74), (70,68).">

<ol>

<li>In this problem, 14 people were asked their age and their height was measured.  Answer the following questions based on the graph.</p>

<ol>
<li>Only one person surveyed was 40 years old.  How tall is this person? ________________</li>
<p class="solution">66 inches</p>

<li>Three people were 62 inches tall.  How old were the three people?  ________________________</li>
<p class="solution">15, 35 and 60 years old</p>

<li>One point represented in the graph has the coordinates (20,76). Explain the meaning of this point within the context of this graph. Use a complete sentence for your explanation.</li>
<p class="solution">A 20 year old in the survey is 76 inches tall.</p>


</ol>

<li>Katie is planning to play Putt Putt with her friends. The Putt Putt course in her town charges $8.00 to rent a club and ball but then only $3.00 for every 18-hole game she golfs. The equation that models this situation is 

<p>y=8.00+3.00x</p>

<p>where x represents the number of games played and y represents the total cost for Katie to golf.  A table of values and a graph for this problem are pictured below.</p>

    A recent graduate of dental school has investigated two different options for her future. She could go to work for a large organization, which will provide her with an office and all that is needed to go with it, or she could start her own business. She has been told that if she chooses the first option, after taxes she could expect to make about $30,000 per year. She learns, however, if she decides to start her own business, she will need an initial investment of $275,000 to buy an office and the equipment needed to set up her practice. She could expect, after taxes, staff salaries and benefits, lab costs, interest on her initial investment, and various other annual costs, to make about $45,000 per year. The system of equations that model this situation is

    <p>y=30000x</p>
    <p>y=45000x-275000</p>
    <p>where x is the number of years she has worked and y represents her salary for each of the two options. The graph of this system is below.</p>

    <img src="images/u2s3p4.png" alt="The graph is two linear equations, each one resenting one of the two options the graduate has for employment. the x-axis represents the time in years and goes from 0 to 30. The y-axis rpresents the accumulated profit and goeas from -300,000 to 1,000,000. The two lines are constructed according to the given equations and intersect at the point (18, 550,000). ">

    <ol>
<li>What does the black line (Option A) on this graph represent? What does the gray line (Option B) on this graph represent? Use complete sentences in your answer.</li>
<p class="solution">Option A is her first job option in which she would be making about $30,000 per year at a larger organization. Option B is her second job option in which she would start her own business.</p>

<li>The point of intersection of the two lines on this graph is (18.33, 550000). In your own words and using complete sentences, please explain what this point of intersection means within the context of this problem.</li>
<p class="solution">If she works for either option for about 18.33 years, she will be making the same amount of money at each, $550,000.</p>

<li>The point (10, 175000) lies on which line? Explain what this point means within the context of this problem. Use a complete sentence in your answer.</li>
<p class="solution">If she chooses to start her own business, she will have accumulated $175,000 in her tenth year.</p>

<li>The point (1, 30000) lies on which line? Explain what this point means within the context of this problem. Use a complete sentence in your answer.</li>
<p class="solution">If she chooses Option A, she will make $30,000 in her first year.</p>
